hello professor and TA,

for proper working of the file we will be needing 
node.js
web sockets-socket.io
express
mongodb

once installed go to the path location-
1. once node and mongodb are installed run mongodb (for running mongo instructions are at the bottom of the page).
2. open gitbash or run command prompt and go the the project location inside Chat folder
3. run the command 'node install' -(if not working could run [node express install --save for all the dependencies persent inside the server file])
4.one every dependencies are installed run 'node server'.
5. and run the localhost:3000 -for chat server which uses socket.io for handshaking,
6. if want to run the home page the run the wamp and run on localhost

Running of mongodb -
1. open cmd and go to the mongodb's bin location (make sure to run as administration if its on C drive)
2. run the command -'mongod'
3. open other terminal and go to the mongodb file location and run the command -'mongo'
4. check if the connectivity is made.
